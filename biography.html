"When I'm, like, 30, I want to go off the map, have a family, and live in Malibu with a farm, and just raise my own chickens." -Kylie Jenner
In 2015, she and her sister Kylie were named to Time magazine’s Most Influential Teens list. That same year, she launched a paid lifestyle app called Kylie, which is estimated to generate millions of dollars for the young businesswoman.
